                        <p>This project is a prototype of a real-time strategy (RTS) game. In this game the player is in charge of managing a series of units to perform different actions.</p>

                        <h2>Units</h2>
                        <p>Units operate with a state machine. There are two types of units, collectors and artillery. Both have several common behaviours:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Idle: the base state where units are idle in one position.</li>
                        <li>Going to: when a unit is moving to a position on the map</li>
                        <li>Going to enemy: is the state in which the character is going to an enemy, either because it was indicated by the player or because an enemy is within the character's vision range.</li>
                        <li>Attacking: when an enemy enters the unit's attack range. Depending on the attack damage and the time it takes them to attack, they will do more or less damage, and every so often.</li>
                        <li>Dying: When the unit dies, it goes into this state. The death animation is executed and then they are removed from the world.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All units have their own life bar, which changes colour as it goes down.</p>

                        <h2>Unit types</h2>
                        <p>The characteristic behaviours of each type are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Artillery: These units attack from a distance, while collectors only have melee attack. Therefore, they enter the attack state when they are further away than collectors.</li>
                        <li>Collector: They have an extra state, which is "Collect". It is basically automatic, as soon as the player orders these units to go to a resource, they will keep collecting resources and taking them to the base. Collectors have a maximum amount of resources they can carry, when they reach the maximum they will go to the base. Once they leave the resources at the base they go back to collecting on their own.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Distance matrix</h2>
                        <p>The distance matrix is responsible for calculating the distance between the units of one team and those of the other.</p>
                        <p>This matrix is responsible for sending information to units about which are in attack or vision range.</p>
                        <p>When a new unit is created it is also entered into the matrix, and when a unit dies it is removed from the matrix.</p>

                        <h2>Player controls</h2>
                        <h3>Camera</h3>
                        <p>The player can move the camera with "WASD", zoom with the mouse scroll and by pressing it they can rotate the camera. Pressing "Shift" will make the above movements faster. Also the speed changes depending on the zoom, the further away the faster.</p>
                        <h3>Select</h3>
                        <p>The player can select units by left clicking. If they drag the mouse while clicking, a rectangle will be displayed and all the units inside it will be selected. Clicking on the ground deselects the selected units.</p>
                        <p>Clicking on the base of the units will select it and activate a panel with two buttons that allow the creation of units in exchange for resources. Units are deselected when the base is clicked.</p>
                        <h3>Actions</h3>
                        <p>Once the units are selected, the player can order them to do different actions by right clicking on different things.</p>
                        <p>If the ground is pressed, the units will change to the "GoingTo" state, go to the position where it was pressed and stand there, not all in the same position, but in a circle around the point.</p>
                        <p>If the player clicks on an enemy unit the units will go into the "GoingToEnemy" state and if they find the enemy they will attack it.</p>
                        <p>If a collection object (space rocks) is clicked and collectors are selected, they will go to the collect state. Artillery will do nothing in this case, even if units of this type are selected.</p>
