                        <p>This game consists of escaping from a room with an object. The problem is that as soon as you take the object, the door of the room closes. You will have to find objects that have a similar weight and place them where the other object was so that the door opens again.</p>
                        <p>As soon as you remove the object from where it is, two doors close. In the room where you are there is an object that you can take and it can open the door to the kitchen (it is not enough weight to open the exit). In the kitchen you will find an object, which added to the one already placed, will be enough to open the exit.</p>
